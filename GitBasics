   git commit -m "Message" (this will commit everything added with a time stamp) 
   git branch <name> (This will take current repo and make a duplicate as a branch) 
   git checkout <hash>  (if don't include final it will move head to hash commit and you can view these files) 
   git checkout main will return the head to the most recent commit 
   git checkout <hash> <file> this will grab the specified file at the specified hash and stage it to be commited in the most recent commit, use this to revert file to old version)
